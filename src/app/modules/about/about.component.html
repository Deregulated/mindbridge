          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            At MindBridge, we're committed to revolutionizing mental healthcare by making it more 
            accessible, affordable, and effective. We believe that mental health is just as important 
            as physical health, and everyone should have the opportunity to receive professional support.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through our innovative platform, we connect individuals with licensed mental health 
            professionals, breaking down barriers like cost, location, and stigma that often prevent 
            people from seeking help.

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <div class="story-text">
          <p>
            MindBridge was founded in 2020 when our CEO, Michael Rodriguez, witnessed firsthand 
            the challenges his friends and family faced in accessing quality mental health care. 
            Despite the growing awareness around mental health, barriers like cost, availability, 
            and stigma continued to prevent people from getting the help they needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            We started with a simple vision: create a platform that makes it easy for anyone to 
            connect with qualified mental health professionals from the comfort and privacy of 
            their own space. Today, we're proud to have helped thousands of individuals take 
            important steps toward better mental wellness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our journey continues as we work to expand access, develop new tools for mental health 
            support, and break down the remaining barriers to care. We believe that together, 
            we can build a world where mental health support is accessible to all.
